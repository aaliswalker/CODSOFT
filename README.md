## About Me

I'm praise, a participant in the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. Passionate about data science, I've undertaken a 4-week journey to explore, learn, and apply the principles of data science to real-world problems while still completing the data science fundamentals with HyperionDev.

## Internship Overview

This internship has been a fantastic opportunity to fully understand what it means to be a data scientist, figuring out how to use code to make data work is definitely not something I was familiar with till now. A few hours of YouTube later I just completed the first project with more to come.  

## Projects

Explore the projects I've worked on during the internship:

- **Project 1: [Titanic Survival Prediction]**
  - The goal was to build a model to predict if someone survived the tianic [1] or not [0].
  - 
  - ...

- **Project 2: []**
  - 

## Getting Started

To explore the projects and my journey in data science, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaliswalker/CODSOFT
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project:**
   ```bash
   cd CODSOFT/Titanic Task 1
   ```

3. **Explore the Code:**
   Open Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to dive into the code for each project.
